This project demonstrates an IoT-based temperature and humidity monitoring system using an ESP32 microcontroller with a DHT22 sensor and ThingSpeak cloud platform. The ESP32 reads real-time temperature and humidity data from the DHT22 sensor, controls an LED based on a predefined temperature threshold, and uploads the sensor readings to ThingSpeak via Wi-Fi for online visualization. Users can monitor live environmental conditions on a ThingSpeak dashboard from anywhere in the world. The project is implemented and tested in the Wokwi simulator, making it easy to replicate in both virtual and real hardware setups.
